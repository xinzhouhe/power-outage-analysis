**Note:** “NA” in the data file indicates data not available.

While there are many columns in the dataset, we aim to primarily focus on the columns that would align with our research interest regarding the question of how do socio-economic factors and historical reliability metrics influence the resilience of power systems in different regions, and can we predict areas with high risk of prolonged outages?
